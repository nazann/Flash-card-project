# Technologies

# How to Run

Ensure the required images and CSV files are in the appropriate directories (e.g., images/card_front.png, images/card_back.png, data/german words.csv).

Run main.py to start the application.

# Usage

Click the green button (✓) for known words to remove them from the learning list.

Click the red button (✗) to revisit the word later.

The app will save progress to words_to_learn.csv automatically.

Enjoy learning!
